<h1> Webstack monitoring </h1>

+ DevOps, SysAdmin, monitoring
+ “You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure” is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems are doing is an important thing.
+ Use the US1 region
+ Install datadog-agent on web-01
+ Create an application key
+ Among the litany of data your monitoring service can report to you are system metrics. You can use these metrics to determine statistics such as reads/writes per second, which can help your company determine if/how they should scale. Set up some monitors within the Datadog dashboard to monitor and alert you of a few.
+ Now create a dashboard with different metrics displayed in order to get a few different visualizations.

+ Create a new dashboard
+ Add at least 4 widgets to your dashboard. They can be of any type and monitor whatever you’d like
+ Create the answer file 2-setup_datadog which has the dashboard_id on the first line.
