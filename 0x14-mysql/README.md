<h1> 0x14. MySQL </h1>

+ DevOps, SysAdmin, MySQL
+ SQL Replication
+ If your important data is stored in an SQL database (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, etc.),
+ you can take advantage of some built-in replication features. These can be used to provide a failover system in case the main server goes down.

<h2> Requirements </h2>

+ All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04.1
+ Bash script files must be executable
+ Shellcheck (version 0.3.7-5~ubuntu16.04.1
+ #!/usr/bin/env bash


<h2> set up process </h2>

+ First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x

+ In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

Create a MySQL user named holberton_user on both web-01 and web-02 with the host name set to localhost and the password projectcorrection280hbtn. This will allow us to access the replication status on both servers.
Make sure that holberton_user has permission to check the primary/replica status of your databases.

+ In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.

Create a database named tyrell_corp.
Within the tyrell_corp database create a table named nexus6 and add at least one entry to it.
Make sure that holberton_user has SELECT permissions on your table so that we can check that the table exists and is not empty.

+ Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.

The name of the new user should be replica_user, with the host name set to %, and can have whatever password you’d like.
replica_user must have the appropriate permissions to replicate your primary MySQL server.
holberton_user will need SELECT privileges on the mysql.user table in order to check that replica_user was created with the correct permissions.

+ MySQL primary must be hosted on web-01 - do not use the bind-address, just comment out this parameter
MySQL replica must be hosted on web-02
Setup replication for the MySQL database named tyrell_corp
Provide your MySQL primary configuration as answer file(my.cnf or mysqld.cnf) with the name 4-mysql_configuration_primary
Provide your MySQL replica configuration as an answer file with the name 4-mysql_configuration_replica

+ The MySQL dump must contain all your MySQL databases
The MySQL dump must be named backup.sql
The MySQL dump file has to be compressed to a tar.gz archive
This archive must have the following name format: day-month-year.tar.gz
The user to connect to the MySQL database must be root
The Bash script accepts one argument that is the password used to connect to the MySQL database
